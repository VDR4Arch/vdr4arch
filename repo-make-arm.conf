# This file is used by repo-make.
# See: http://repo-make.tuxfamily.org/
# It allows to autobuild the package set on a dedicated (virtual) build machine

#
# While in theory all the packages with "arm*" in their ARCH array may build on
# ARM this is not useful for most of them.
#
# This file is moved in place of the "repo-make.conf" file for ARM autobuild.
# The primary reason is that building for ARM takes longer than for x86_64.
#
# You may request to have packages that you use to be added here, but only with
# very good reasons and with some kind of proof that it actually works well on
# ARM (performance is OK):
